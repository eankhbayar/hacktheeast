# Architecture Overview

## Summary

Simple React Native app for interrupting kids' scrolling with quizzes. Parents configure via dashboard. Use API placeholders for AI/question generation.

## Key Features

- Parent login / dashboard / settings.
- Timer-based interruptions.
- Quiz flow: info/video (placeholder) + multiple-choice question.
- **Alarmy-style lock-in** – interruption takes over the screen and cannot be dismissed until the required quiz/task is completed.
- Points on correct answers.
- Reset timer after each interruption.

## Screens & Components

- Login: Email/password.
- Dashboard: Kids' stats (weak topics, time spent, suggestions) from API.
- Settings: Interval, kids' configs (age, topics).
- Kid Mode: Background timer triggers quiz.
- Quiz: Display info, question, options. Correct: points++, reset. Wrong: retry.

## Backend APIs (Placeholders)

- Auth: `/login`
- Dashboard: `/dashboard?userId=xx`
- Settings: `/settings` (POST)
- Question: `/generateQuestion?topic=xx&age=xx` → `{question, options, answer, info}`
- Stats: `/updateStats` (POST)

## Flows

### Parent

- Login.
- View dashboard.
- Edit settings → Save.
- Exit; timer starts.

### Kid

- Timer → full-screen, Alarmy-style Quiz (cannot be easily dismissed or skipped).
- Info → Question → Answer.
- Correct: Points, reset, exit.
- Wrong: Retry.
- Track time locally, sync later.

## Tech Stack & Implementation Notes

- React Native.
- State: Context API.
- Timer: `react-native-background-timer`.
- Storage: `AsyncStorage`.
- API: Axios mocks.

## Notes

- Mocks for demo.
- Minimal UI.

## Open Questions / To Clarify

- ignore that for now, that is for feeding the data into the app – how do agents 1–4, the knowledge base, and the “learning app” from your diagram map onto this simplified architecture?
- same mobile app – should parent and child experiences live in a single mobile app bundle, or will there be separate apps or modes?
- always-online – which parts must be offline‑friendly vs. always-online?
